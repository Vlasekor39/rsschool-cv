## **About me:**
* _Hello! I am 39 years old. I want to learn and develop. My main goal: self-development. I want to change my profession, become a developer. This is not my first attempt, but probably due to laziness and lack of understanding of some basics in programming languages, as well as almost zero knowledge of English, I lost the desire to study further. But I want to overcome myself, prove to myself that I’m great. Worst character trait: touchiness, but I’m working on it._
